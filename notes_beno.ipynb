    "Note that you can also get this information from the `object_id` column (`object_id` < 1,000,000 are in DDF).  \n",
    "The DDFs will have more observations, but cover a much smaller chunk of sky. Consequently, the light curves will have better sampling, and potentially be found farther away in our Universe, but there's fewer objects. You may wish to treat the DDF and WFD objects separately and build different sorts of classifiers for them. This is entirely up to you, and the two sets of objects are weighted exactly the same, irrespective of which field they originated from."

    "The training set has spectroscopic redshifts for all sources. You'll notice quickly that they don't always agree with the photometric redshift. The photometric redshift is sometimes wrong. Consequently, we also give you an estimate of the 68% uncertainty on the photometric redshift (which itself might be inaccurate...) - `hostgal_photoz_err`. Be warned though that the actual photometric redshift distribution is asymmetric, and the redshift is not likely to be less than zero, so you might want to treat it as just a weight. Why is the redshift unlikely to be less than 0... we'll get to that in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test set does not have spectroscopic redshifts for all sources. There's a few because we simulate occasionally getting lucky and finding a new source in a galaxy which already had spectroscopy, but the vast majority of them will be `NaN`. You could potentially try to use the training set, together with the subset of the test data that does have both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts to make a better redshift predictor if you like, or you could ignore it altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, redshift is a great feature! We know how to separate extragalactic and galactic sources pretty well, so we simulate this ability by setting the redshifts of galactic sources to exactly `0`. That tells you they are within the galaxy and reduces the size of the possible models they might be, but doesn't identify which is which - that's still your challenge! Most machine learning techniques will pick this feature of redshift up easily, but you might use it to build separate classifiers for extragalactic and galactic sources if you like."
